# Terminal UI

## Goal
Deliver a terminal-based frontend that mirrors the core Synthetic experience, powered by `@sst/opentui`.

## Key Requirements
- Reuse existing APIs so the TUI presents construct lists, chat, diff, and service status.
- Support keyboard shortcuts for command menu actions and construct navigation.
- Handle streaming logs and notifications within the terminal context.
- Consider multi-construct workflows (tabs/panes) similar to the web UI.
