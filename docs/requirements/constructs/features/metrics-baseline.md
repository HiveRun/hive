# Metrics Baseline

## Goal
Capture baseline metrics for each construct so we can measure effectiveness and identify bottlenecks.

## Key Requirements
- Record timestamps for key lifecycle events (start, awaiting input, resumed, completed).
- Track human intervention count and agent retries.
- Surface metrics in a lightweight dashboard (per construct and aggregate).
- Export raw metrics for external analysis.
