# Linear Integration

## Goal
Integrate Synthetic constructs with Linear so planning and implementation work can originate from and sync back to product tracking.

## Key Requirements
- Authenticate with Linear (per user or workspace token).
- Allow creating a construct directly from a Linear issue (pull title/description, attach links).
- Update Linear status/labels as the construct progresses (planning approved, implementation completed).
- Optionally push plan artifacts or summaries back into the Linear issue comments.
