# Cross-Construct Search

## Goal
Enable searching across transcripts, service logs, plans, and diff metadata so operators can reuse prior work or investigate historical context quickly.

## Key Requirements
- Index construct transcripts, plan submissions, service logs, and diff summaries.
- Support keyword search with filters (by construct, date range, construct type).
- Provide quick links from search results into the relevant construct view (chat, diff, plan).
- Consider per-workspace indexing to keep scope manageable.
