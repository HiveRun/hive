# Insight Analytics

- [ ] Insight Analytics #status/planned #phase-4 #feature/advanced

## Goal
Provide higher-level analytics on construct activity so teams can monitor throughput and identify optimisation opportunities.

## Key Requirements
- Aggregate metrics (cycle time, agent idle time, awaiting-input backlog) over time.
- Offer filters by workspace, construct type, and template.
- Visualise trends (line charts, heatmaps) and support export to CSV/JSON.
- Highlight outliers or constructs needing attention (e.g., repeated errors, long idle periods).
