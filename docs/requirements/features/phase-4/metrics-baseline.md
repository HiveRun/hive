# Metrics Baseline

- [ ] Metrics Baseline #status/planned #phase-4 #feature/advanced

## Goal
Capture baseline metrics for each cell so we can measure effectiveness and identify bottlenecks.

## Key Requirements
- Record timestamps for key lifecycle events (start, awaiting input, resumed, completed).
- Track human intervention count and agent retries.
- Surface metrics in a lightweight dashboard (per cell and aggregate).
- Export raw metrics for external analysis.
