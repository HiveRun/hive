# Cross-Cell Search

- [ ] Cross-Cell Search #status/planned #phase-2 #feature/advanced

## Goal
Enable searching across transcripts, service logs, plans, and diff metadata so operators can reuse prior work or investigate past context quickly.

## Key Requirements
- Index cell transcripts, plan submissions, service logs, and diff summaries.
- Support keyword search with filters (by cell, date range, cell type).
- Provide quick links from search results into the relevant cell view (chat, diff, plan).
- Consider per-workspace indexing to keep scope manageable.
