# Voice Input

## Goal
Add voice capture to the agent chat so operators can speak prompts and have them transcribed into the conversation.

## Key Requirements
- Provide push-to-talk controls in the chat UI (web and future TUI).
- Use a local or cloud transcription service with configurable model selection.
- Display transcription for confirmation before sending to the agent.
- Respect privacy: allow opting out of audio capture and purge recordings after transcription.
