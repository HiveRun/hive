# Tasks

## Stack
List the tasks you care about in the order you plan to tackle them—top to bottom. Keep each entry as a checklist item that links to the task note.
- [ ] [[tasks/...]]
- [ ] [[tasks/...]]

## By Theme
If useful, mirror the list grouped by `theme-*` tags so parallel workstreams stay visible.
- theme-platform
  - [ ] [[tasks/...]]
- theme-runtime
  - [ ] [[tasks/...]]
