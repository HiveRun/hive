# Current Agent Work

## Task Snapshot
Copy the top few items from `docs/tasks/index.md` here when you hand work to an agent so expectations are obvious.
- [ ] [[tasks/...]]
- [ ] [[tasks/...]]

## Tasks by Theme
Optional breakdown to make context switching easier. Edit manually when the stack changes.
- theme-platform → [[tasks/...]]
- theme-runtime → [[tasks/...]]

## Ready Requirements
Link the requirement notes that are ready for implementation so agents see the big picture.
- [[requirements/...]]
- [[requirements/...]]

## Notes
Pick the next task manually; this file is just a snapshot. Theme tags (`theme-*`) help slice the work without introducing extra metadata.
