# AI Tooling

- Regenerate `AGENTS.md` with `bun run ruler:apply`; it concatenates `.ruler/prompts/*.md` in priority order.
- Keep authoring guidance in this directory so automated agents inherit updates without manual edits.
- No Cursor or GitHub Copilot override files exist; Ruler prompts are the single source of truth for agent context.
- When adding new workflows, prefer short, action-focused bullets so the generated handbook stays compact (~20 lines).
- Commit prompt changes like any other source code so CI and Husky enforce lint/type/build checks.
